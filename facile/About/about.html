			<article class="aboutMe"><h2>Joachim</h2><p>"To all of this I agreed, staying in my house and for the first time in  my life attempting to cook. And the plague did not come out on me. By  means of the telephone I could talk with whomsoever I pleased and get  the news. Also, there were the newspapers, and I ordered all of them to  be thrown up to my door so that I could know what was happening with the  rest of the world.</p>
			<p>"New York City and Chicago were in chaos. And what happened with them  was happening in all the large cities. A third of the New York police  were dead. Their chief was also dead, likewise the mayor. All law and  order had ceased. The bodies were lying in the streets un-buried. All  railroads and vessels carrying food and such things into the great  city had ceased runnings and mobs of the hungry poor were pillaging  the stores and warehouses. Murder and robbery and drunkenness were  everywhere. Already the people had fled from the city by millions&mdash;at  first the rich, in their private motor-cars and dirigibles, and then the  great mass of the population, on foot, carrying the plague with them,  themselves starving and pillaging the farmers and all the towns and  villages on the way.</p></article>

<p>"It must be inconvenient to be made of flesh," said the Scarecrow thoughtfully, "for you must sleep, and eat and drink.  However, you have brains, and it is worth a lot of bother to be able to think properly."</p>
<p>They left the cottage and walked through the trees until they found a little spring of clear water, where Dorothy drank and bathed and ate her breakfast.  She saw there was not much bread left in the basket, and the girl was thankful the Scarecrow did not have to eat anything, for there was scarcely enough for herself and Toto for the day.</p>
<p>When she had finished her meal, and was about to go back to the road of yellow brick, she was startled to hear a deep groan near by.</p></article>

		<article class="aboutMe"><h2>Person</h2><p>The most extraordinary thing to my mind, of all the strange and wonderful things that happened upon that Friday, was the dovetailing of the commonplace habits of our social order with the first beginnings of the series of events that was to topple that social order headlong.  If on Friday night you had taken a pair of compasses and drawn a circle with a radius of five miles round the Woking sand pits, I doubt if you would have had one human being outside it, unless it were some relation of Stent or of the three or four cyclists or London people lying dead on the common, whose emotions or habits were at all affected by the new-comers.  Many people had heard of the cylinder, of course, and talked about it in their leisure, but it certainly did not make the sensation that an ultimatum to Germany would have done.</p>
		<p>In London that night poor Henderson's telegram describing the gradual unscrewing of the shot was judged to be a canard, and his evening paper, after wiring for authentication from him and receiving no reply--the man was killed--decided not to print a special edition.</p></article>
